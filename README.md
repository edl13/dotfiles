# Mark's "Dot" Files

I'm finally biting the bullet after manually duplicating my user configuration
on multiple systems and setting up a configuratin script to do this more
gracefully.  You'll need ``git`` and ``vim`` to be installed for the setup
script to work.

## How To Setup
```
cd ``$HOME/.config``
git clone git@gitlab.oit.duke.edu:mlp6/dotfiles.git
bash ./setup.sh
```

## What will be setup?
* bash and zsh configurations
* vim and associated bundles
* git configurations
* $HOME directory structure
